# Cinema-Homework-Project
This is an university project
This project is for cinemas. 
On the website, we can check the daily programs of the cinema, and we can order seats to its shows.
The desktop application helps in the employee workflow. 
They can add movies to the database (also can update and delete), can create programs, and sell the seats of a chosen program.
